    """
    Calculate the threshold and concentration of a portfolio based on a target column and expected return.

    This function sorts the DataFrame within a Calculator object based on 'overall_score' and calculates
    the cumulative sum and ratio of the target column. It determines the maximum 'overall_score' where
    the cumulative ratio exceeds the expected return. The concentration is the proportion of data points
    with an 'overall_score' higher than this threshold.

    Args:
        calculator: An instance of Calculator, expected to contain a DataFrame and an attribute 'df_len' for the length of the DataFrame.
        target_column: The column name in the DataFrame for which concentration is calculated.
        mask_column: The column name in the DataFrame to mask the data, defaults to None. If None, no masking is applied.
        expected_return: The expected cumulative ratio, defaults to 0.95. If None, it's set to 0.95.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - threshold (float): The 'overall_score' value above which the expected return is met or exceeded.
        - concentration (float): The proportion of data points with 'overall_score' greater than the threshold.
